3. Use the following program fragment for questions a–e below. Use the following test inputs: t1 = f1 (0, 0) t2 = f1 (1, 1) t3 = f1 (0, 1) t4 = f1 (3, 2) t5 = f1 (3, 4) (a) Draw the call graph for this program fragment. (b) Give the path in the graph followed by each test. (c) Find a minimal test set that achieves Node Coverage. (d) Find a minimal test set that achieves Edge Coverage. (e) Give the prime paths in the graph. Which prime path is not covered by any of the tests above?

b)
- t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6] 
- t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6] 
- t3: [f1, f2] 
- t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6] 
- t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6]

c) {t1, t2, t3}, {t1, t3, t4}, or {t1, t5}.

d) {t1, t5}

e) There are 4 prime paths: {[f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6]}. The second path is not covered by the given test paths.
