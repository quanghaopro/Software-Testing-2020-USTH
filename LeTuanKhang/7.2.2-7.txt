(a) p2 and p3 are test paths. p1 does not terminate at a final node. p4 does not
start at an initial node. p5 includes an edge that does not exist in the graph (3, 2).
(b) The edge pairs are:
{ [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3] }
(c) No. Neither p2 nor p3 tours either of the following edge-pairs:
{ [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3] }
As discussed in (part a), the remaining candidate paths are not test paths.
(d) : p3 does not directly tour the prime path. However, p3 does tour the prime path
with the sidetrip [1, 2, 1].
