The text suggests both ‘2’ and ‘1’ base choices for side 1. This give two base tests:(2,2,2) and (1,2,2). According to the formula given in the text, we should get 2(base) + 6 + 6 + 6 = 20 (not 18, as erroneously stated in the text) tests.However, 4 of these are redundant, so the result is 16. To clarify, we list all 20 tests, withthe base choices listed first:
{(2,2,2),(1,2,2)(2,1,2),(2,0,2),(2,−1,2),(2,2,1),(2,2,0),(2,2,−1),(1,2,2),(0,2,2),(−1,2,2),(1,2,1),(1,2,0),(1,2,−1),(1,1,2),(1,0,2),(1,−1,2),(2,2,2),(0,2,2),(−1,2,2)}
Here are the 16 nonredundant tests:
{(2,2,2),(1,2,2)(2,1,2),(2,0,2),(2,−1,2),(2,2,1),(2,2,0),(2,2,−1),(0,2,2),(−1,2,2),(1,2,1),(1,2,0),(1,2,−1),(1,1,2),(1,0,2),(1,−1,2)}
