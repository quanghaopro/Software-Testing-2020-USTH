# Code with the Mutant instead of the original:
``` Java
public static int sum(int[] x)
   {
      int s = 0;
      for (int i=0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         s = s - x[i];
      }
      return s;
   }
```
# a) and b)
There are no test that can sastify these requirement

# c)
let the array = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}

# d)
let the array = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
