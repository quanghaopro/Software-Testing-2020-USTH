D-U Pairs : [1,3], [1,6], [3,3], [3,6]

D-U Paths : [1,2,6], [1,2,3], [3,5,2,3], [3,5,2,6], [3,4,5,2,3], [3,4,5,2,6]

c,

A test path p tours subpath q if q is a subpath of p

Test Path:
+ t1 = [1,2,6]
+ t2 = [1,2,3,4,5,2,3,5,2,6]
+ t3 = [1,2,3,5,2,3,4,5,2,6]
+ t4 = [1,2,3,5,2,6]

D-U Paths toured:
+ [1,2,6]
+ [1,2,3], [1,2,6], [3,5,2,6], [3,4,5,2,3], [3,4,5,2,6]
+ [1,2,3], [1,2,6], [3,5,2,3], [3,5,2,6], [3,4,5,2,6]
+ [1,2,3], [1,2,6], [3,5,2,6]

d,

t2=[1,2,3,4,5,2,3,5,2,6]

This test path satisfies all defs by touring at least one path for at least one use for each def
(Path toured are : [1,2,3], [3,5,2,6])

e,

t1 = [1,2,6]
t2 = [1,2,3,4,5,2,3,5,2,6]

These two test paths together satisfy all uses coverage by touring at least one path for each def-use pair.
(Paths toured are [1,2,3], [1,2,6], [3,4,5,2,3], [3,5,2,6])

f,

t1 = [1,2,6]
t2 = [1,2,3,4,5,2,3,5,2,6]
t3 = [1,2,3,5,2,3,4,5,2,6]

These three test paths together satisfy DU-paths coverage with respect to x.
