## Ex 7.5-1
```
a)

The four values for elements are [ null, null ], [ obj, null ], [ null, obj ] and [ obj, obj ]
[ obj, null ] and [ null, obj ] are different at the representation level

b)

The number of states = Element * size * front * back = 4 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 48 total states.

c)

Of the 48 states, only 6 are reachable.

d + e,

The exceptions (enqueue() on full queues and dequeue() on empty queues) as well as observer method. Result in "loop transitions from a state back to itself.
These are not shown on the diagram for clarity and from a grading perspective, aren't relevant. Labels on nodes show the values of the representation state variables : Elements, size, front and back.
```
f) Small test :
```Java
Queue q = new Queue();
Object obj = new Object();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
q.dequeue();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
```
